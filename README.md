# atom-beautify package

[Beautify](https://github.com/einars/js-beautify) HTML, CSS and Javascript in Atom.

*Attention*: A different package with a similar name exist. Maybe you want to visit this one: [Beautifier](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautifier).

## Usage

Open the Command Palette, and type `Beautify`. This will beautify JS, HTML or CSS files. (XML is supported as an experimental feature.) It will only beautify selected text, if a selection is found - if not, the whole file will be beautified.

You can also type `ctrl-alt-b` as a shortcut or click `Packages > Beautify` in the menu.

You can also choose to beautify on every file save.
